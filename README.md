# geneva_libraries_app

A simple mobile app developed with Flutter to see what libraries are open in Geneva at a certain time.

## Description

The database for the libraries schedule is under assets/library_schedules.json

In case it is out of date, please open a PR and I will update it.

Run ``flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`` for model related code generation.
